# Procedure
1. **Initial Inspection:**  
   - Disconnect the battery and power off the drone.  
   - Visually inspect the battery for any signs of swelling, leakage, or damage.  
   - Examine soldering points and connections for looseness or corrosion.  

2. **Battery Diagnosis:**  
   - Measure battery voltage using a multimeter.  
   - Ensure proper charge levels and balance across cells.  
   - Replace the battery if significant degradation is observed.  

3. **PMU Inspection:**  
   - Check PMU connections with components like the flight controller and ESC.  
   - Inspect for physical damage or burnt marks on the PMU circuit.  
   - Use diagnostic LED indicators (if available) to verify functionality.  

4. **Repair and Maintenance:**  
   - Resolder any loose or weak connections.  
   - Replace damaged components such as cables or connectors.  
   - Secure all connections and reassemble the drone.  

5. **Final Testing:**  
   - Reconnect the battery and power on the drone.  
   - Perform a test flight to ensure proper functioning.  
   - Monitor for any abnormal behavior or power fluctuations.
