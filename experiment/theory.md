# Theory
Drones rely on a stable power supply for efficient operation, which is provided by the battery and regulated by the Power Management Unit (PMU). The battery stores and supplies electrical energy, while the PMU distributes power to various drone components, including the flight controller, motors, and sensors.

Common issues affecting drone performance include:

1. **Battery Issues:**  
   - Swelling or puffing due to overcharging or aging.  
   - Low voltage leading to power failure.  
   - Loose or corroded terminals affecting connectivity.  

2. **PMU Issues:**  
   - Faulty power distribution causing irregular drone behavior.  
   - Loose solder joints disrupting power flow.  
   - Malfunctioning electronic components due to physical damage.  

Routine maintenance, such as checking solder joints, inspecting physical damage, and ensuring proper connections, is crucial to prevent in-flight failures and prolong drone lifespan.
